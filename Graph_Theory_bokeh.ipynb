    "\n",
    "The edges of the above graph have no directions meaning that the edge from one vertex A to another vertex B is the same as from vertex B to vertex A. Such a graph is called an undirected graph. Similarly, a graph having a direction associated with each edge is known as a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path from vertex x to y in a graph is a list of vertices, in which successive vertices are connected by edges in the graph. For example, FGHE is path from F to E in the graph above. A simple path is a path with no vertex repeated. For example, FGHEG is not a simple path.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph. Intuitively, if the vertices were physical objects and the edges were strings connecting them, a connected graph would stay in one piece if picked up by any vertex. A graph which is not connected is made up of connected components. For example, the graph above has two connected components: {A, B, D} and {C, E, F, G, H}.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cycle is a path, which is simple except that the first and last vertex are the same (a path from a point back to itself). For example, the path HEGH is a cycle in our example. Vertices must be listed in the order that they are traveled to make the path; any of the vertices may be listed first. Thus, HEGH and EHGE are different ways to identify the same cycle. For clarity, we list the start / end vertex twice: once at the start of the cycle and once at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll denote the number of vertices in a given graph by V and the number of edges by E. Note that E can range anywhere from \\\\((V  to  V^2)\\\\)  or \\\\( V(V−1)/2\\\\) in an undirected graph). Graphs with all edges present are called complete graphs; graphs with relatively few edges present (say less than Vlog(V)) are called sparse; graphs with relatively few edges missing are called dense."
